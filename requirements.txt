In this example, `selenium` is listed with a specific version (you can replace this with the version you need), and `webdriver_manager` is another library that might be used in conjunction with Selenium.

Remember to update the versions to match the specific versions you are using in your project. You can find the latest versions on the [Python Package Index (PyPI)](https://pypi.org/).

Feel free to add or remove dependencies based on the requirements of your project. Once you've created the `requirements.txt` file, others can use it to install the necessary dependencies by running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
